{{ packagename }} provides functions to ....

<!-- This sentence is optional and can be removed -->
{{ packagename }} is developed at the [CENTER|similar](url) at the [UNIVERSITY|similar](url) as part of the [Epiverse-TRACE program](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of {{ packagename }} from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("{{ gh_repo }}")
```

## Example

These examples illustrate some of the current functionalities


## Development

### Lifecycle

This package is currently a *concept*, as defined by the [RECON software
lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). This means that essential
features and mechanisms are still being developed, and the package is not ready
for use outside of the development team.


### Contributions

Contributions are welcome via [pull requests](https://github.com/{{ gh_repo }}/pulls).

### Code of Conduct

Please note that the {{ packagename }} project is released with a 
[Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Command line instructions: Create a new Github repository using a template

There's a shortcut to this, which is provided here for people short on time, but the scenic route follows.

**Github command line client**

Install the Github command line client `gh` following the instructions for your OS here: https://github.com/cli/cli.
Run `gh auth login` to link your device with your Github account the first time you use the CLI.

Once installed and authenticated, run:

```sh
gh repo create epiverse-trace/mypackage --public --template=epiverse-trace/packagetemplate
```

Clone the repository as usual using your preferred method.

### Command line instructions: Create a repo and R package from scratch

#### Make an R project

```sh
Rscript -e 'devtools::create("mypackage")'
```

or

```sh
Rscript -e 'usethis::create_package("mypackage")'
```

#### Initialise a git repository

```sh
cd mypackage
git init
```

#### Create a remote Github repository

**Github command line client**

Install the Github command line client `gh` following the instructions for your OS here: https://github.com/cli/cli.
Run `gh auth login` to link your device with your Github account the first time you use the CLI.

Create the package repository in the _Epiverse TRACE_ organisation.

```sh
# still in mypackage
gh repo create epiverse-trace/mypackage
```

#### Initial commit to main

```sh
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

#### Get R-related .gitignore

Getting `R.gitignore` from https://github.com/github/gitignore, and renaming it to `.gitignore`.

`wget` is cross platform and should be available on most systems. Alternatives using `curl` exist.

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/R.gitignore
mv R.gitignore .gitignore
```

#### Set up R package components

These next steps are from the R command line.
If you are prompted to copy or edit text in the terminal (especially if you launched R from the terminal using `$ R`), you might be in Vim. Exit by typing `:wq`, and edit these files in a text editor.

1. Populate fields in the DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE

```r
# e.g. using data.table
usethis::use_package("data.table")
```

Actually `data.table` requires a bit more configuration to use many of its features, such as `:=` and `.SD`. Use instead:

```r
usethis::use_data_table()
```

2. Set up unit testing infrastructure

```r
usethis::use_testthat()

# and a basic test file
usethis::use_test("basic-test")

# code coverage YAML for codecov
usethis::use_coverage("codecov")
```

3. Set a licence

We prefer the MIT licence, primarily because it is short and easy to read.

```r
usethis::use_mit_licence()
```

4. Make a README page

```r
usethis::use_readme_rmd()
```

Readme.md can be updated manually from the Readme.Rmd created above, using

```r
devtools::build_readme()
```

or using a Github Actions setup (see the examples here https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2-branch/examples).

5. Set up continuous integration using Github Actions

```r
# to check package installation
usethis::use_github_actions_check_standard()

# to report code coverage results to codecov
usethis::use_github_action("test-coverage")
```

6. Set up documentation

a. Document the package as required using

```r
devtools::document()
```

b. Set up a `pkgdown` website.

```r
# configure the pkgdown YAML.
# can be saved and edited later
usethis::use_pkgdown()

# build the website using
pkgdown::build_site()
```

Or set up a Github Actions job using `usethis::use_github_action("pkgdown")`.
